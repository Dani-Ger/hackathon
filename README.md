All participants of Hackathon 2.0 must abide by the Code of Conduct and IP agreement below. Participants violating the code of coduct may be asked to leave the event and the Museum.

CODE OF CONDUCT
We value the participation of each member of the community and want everyone to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other hackathon participants, Museum visitors, and Museum staff.

To make clear what is expected, all participants associated with the Philadelphia Museum of Art Hackathon are required to adhere to the following Code of Conduct (including the Short and Long Versions).

The Short Version
The Philadelphia Museum of Art is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants, staff, or visitors in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Be respectful. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event and the Museum.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Long Version
Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, pornographic or obscene images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording without voluntary consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment can include any behavior that makes another person feel targeted or uncomfortable.

Photography is encouraged, but participants, staff, and/or Museum visitors must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).   You must also follow the Museum’s policies relating to photography in the galleries as may be communicated by Museum staff or security guards.

As this is a hackathon we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type. 

We expect participants to follow the code of conduct and other Museum policies throughout the Museum as communicated by Museum staff or security guards.  At all times be respectful of the art and other property at the Museum and do not touch or endanger any art objects at any time.

The Museum reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part.  If you have any questions regarding these policies, please speak with a Museum staff member.

Reporting Procedures and Contact Information
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately. If you prefer email, please report it using the email below:

All reporters have the right to remain anonymous. We value your attendance. Museum staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon.
